perf(1) is the standard Linux profiler, a multi-tool with many uses.\\

# CPU Summary Profiling

The following uses perf(1) to sample stack traces (-g) across all CPUs (-a) at 51 Hertz (-F 49: samples per second) for 30 seconds, and then to list the samples:

```bash
perf record -F 49 -a -g -- sleep 30
perf script
```

# CPU Flame Graphs

```bash
perf record -F 49 -a -g -- sleep 10; perf script --header > out.stacks
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph; cd FlameGraph
./stackcollapse-perf.pl < ../out.stacks | ./flamegraph.pl --hash > out.svg
```

# Syscall Tracing

The perf(1) `trace` subcommand traces system calls by default, and is perf(1)â€™s version of strace(1).\
For example, tracing a MySQL server process:

```shell
perf trace -p $(pgrep mysqld)
```

The advantage of perf(1) is that it uses per-CPU buffers to reduce the overhead, making it much safer to use than the current implementation of strace(1).\
It can also trace system-wide, whereas strace(1) is limited to a set of processes (typically a single process), and it can trace events other than syscalls.\
perf(1), however, does not have as many syscall argument translations as strace(1);

# Kernel Time Analysis

As perf(1) trace shows time in syscalls, it helps explain the system CPU time commonly shown by monitoring tools,\
although it is easier to start with a summary than the event-by-event output. perf(1) trace summarizes syscalls with `-s`:

```shell
perf trace -s -p $(pgrep mysqld)

# mysqld (14169), 225186 events, 99.1%
#
#    syscall            calls    total       min       avg       max      stddev
#                                (msec)    (msec)    (msec)    (msec)        (%)
#    --------------- -------- --------- --------- --------- ---------     ------
#    sendto             27239   267.904     0.002     0.010     0.109      0.28%
#    recvfrom           69861   212.213     0.001     0.003     0.069      0.23%
#    ppoll              15478   201.183     0.002     0.013     0.412      0.75%

```Analysis
The earlier output showing futex(2) calls is not very interesting in isolation, and running perf(1) trace on any busy application will produce an avalanche of output.
It helps to start with this summary first, and then to use perf(1) trace with a filter to inspect only the syscall types of interest.
